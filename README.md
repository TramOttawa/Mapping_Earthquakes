# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Background

Basil and Sadhana like how you created your earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. Now, Basil and Sadhana would like to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and they would like to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, and they would like to see the data on a third map.

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days. To complete this project, use a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website and retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. Then add the data to a map and all the results can be seen visually.

## Results

* The earthquake data and tectonic plate data displayed on the map when the page loads
* The final map displays all the different earthquakes around the world. The circle-marker's size and color was correlated to the earthquake's magnitude.

* All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the map when the page loads and the datasets can be toggled on or off between all earthquakes, major earthquakes, and the tectonic plates.

* A third map tile layer was created and it was added to the overlay object
* All the earthquake data and tectonic plate data are displayed on the all maps of the webpage
